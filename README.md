# NuBlox

**NuBlox** is the next-generation, meta-driven SQL application builder.  
Design, manage, and deploy database applications visually—compatible with any major SQL dialect.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Meta-Driven Design:**  
  Model your database with abstracted meta-tables—build apps faster, with less code.
- **Universal SQL Dialect Support:**  
  Generate and manage schema for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle, and more.
- **Workspace & Projects:**  
  Multi-tenant architecture supporting teams, workspaces, and collaborative projects.
- **Visual Database Designer:**  
  Drag-and-drop table/field editor, relations, constraints, and advanced object support.
- **SQL Codegen Engine:**  
  Instantly preview and export schema/DDL for any RDBMS.
- **User Management:**  
  Onboarding, profiles, role-based access, and secure credential storage.
- **Modern UI:**  
  Built with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS for a fast, responsive experience.
- **API-First:**  
  Secure REST endpoints for meta-operations and database execution.
- **Extensible:**  
  Easily add custom fields, validations, triggers, or automation.

## 🚦 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/8140spitt/DbStudio.git
   cd DbStudio
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   # or yarn / npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment:**

   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in database credentials.

4. **Run migrations:**

   ```sh
   pnpm drizzle-kit push:mysql
   ```

5. **Start the dev server:**

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   # Or for production:
   # pnpm build && pnpm preview
   ```

---

## 🌍 Usage

* Register an account, create a workspace and project.
* Use the visual designer to define your schema and relationships.
* Preview, export, and push SQL to your connected database.

---

## 🧱 Meta-Driven Data Model

NuBlox uses meta-tables to describe your application:

* **Meta Tables:**
  Tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, triggers, and more are stored as rows in meta tables.
* **Schema Generation:**
  Generate SQL DDL for any dialect—extensible with adapters for new RDBMS.
* **User/Workspace Isolation:**
  Each user’s data is isolated by workspace/project.

---

## 🔐 Security & Auth

* Passwords hashed with `crypto`/bcrypt (never stored in plain text).
* Sessions, credential types, and role-based access by workspace/project.
* All sensitive data follows modern security best practices.

---

## 📦 Roadmap

* [x] Meta schema for all SQL objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.)
* [x] Workspace/project/user management
* [x] Visual designer MVP
* [ ] Automated DDL codegen for all supported dialects
* [ ] Live schema sync to RDBMS
* [ ] Page/form/app builder (low-code/no-code)
* [ ] Multi-RDBMS testing support (docker)
* [ ] Plugin/extension system
